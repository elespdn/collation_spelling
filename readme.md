# Normalization in machine-assisted collation


Examples | Case studies:




## Old approach

Compare ways of collating, with fuzzy match or normalization (manual or automatic).

- Example 1
- Example 2
- Example 3



## Normalization for the alignment and for the analysis

Normalization is performed in step 2 and in step 4 of the Gothenburg model, and then visualized in step 5. For each token, two optional properties can be linked, with the normalized form for a correct alignemnt and with the normalized form for analyis. Exploring visualization.

- Example 4



## Normalization affects the alignment

Normalization is performed in step 2 of the Gothenburg model, in order to improve the alignment.

- Example 5



# Normalization and near_match affect the alignment

- Example 6



# Near_match affects the alignment

- Example 7
