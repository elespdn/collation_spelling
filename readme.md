Examples | Case studies:



### Normalization for the alignment and for the analysis

Normalization is performed in step 2 and in step 4 of the Gothenburg model, and then visualized in step 5. For each token, two optional properties can be linked, with the normalized form for a correct alignemnt and with the normalized form for analyis. Exploring visualization.

- Example 4



### Normalization affects the alignment

Normalization is performed in step 2 of the Gothenburg model, in order to improve the alignment.

- Example 5



### Normalization and near_match affect the alignment

- Example 6



### Near_match affects the alignment

- Example 7



### Old approach

Compare ways of collating: fuzzy match or normalization (manual or automatic).
