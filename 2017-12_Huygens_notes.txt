check version
	pip show collatex


install new release
	pip install --upgrade --pre collatex


New version of CollateX
2.1.3rc1


Install pygraphviz <https://anaconda.org/bioconda/pygraphviz>
	conda install -c bioconda pygraphviz


If problems with networkx
The second one (on Linux) is caused by a version difference in the networkx library. NetworkX recently updated itself to version 2.0, breaking API compatibility with previous 1.x versions. CollateX Python at the moment only works with networkx version 1.X. First uninstall the current networkx version by typing ‘pip uninstall networkx’ (without the quotes) and then install the working version by typing 
'pip install -Iv networkx==1.11'without the qoutes.

## EXAMPLES

##	Example 1
Simple, no collation problems. 


##	Example 2
Attention to 'chevalier' vs 'chevalerie'; it might seem orthographic variation, but it is not.

## NEAR MATCH

####################

Near_match after the exact match (initial) looks at variations and gaps

Nearmatch works on the entire set as result of the first exact match and readjust the graph

##
## TO DO
##
####################



- NEAR_MATCH
Near match without gaps
	Select variation phenomena


- VISUALIZATION
In the alignment table the orthographic variation is completely lost. Add another color for match on the normalized form (where the original forms are different).


- CUSTOMIZE MATCH FOR AUTOMATIC DICTIONARY
For NLP normalization, different match: not only the same (or near), but if they have the same POS (before '_') and one contains the other.
Ex. reine [NOM_regne|rein|röine] vs roine [NOM_röine]   should be aligned, they have the same POS ('NOM_') and the second is contained in the first ('röine')

To do after (Ele)

- Train TreeTagger with FROLEX lexicon available at <https://github.com/sheiden/Medieval-French-Language-Toolkit>

- Study NLP approaches (for instance, contextual information. Vd. Doc and readme TreeTagger, Article Kestemont)
